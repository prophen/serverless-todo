# Notes on [Initializing a new git repo with Github's hub CLI](https://egghead.io/lessons/git-initializing-a-new-git-repo-with-github-s-hub-cli?pl=building-a-serverless-jamstack-todo-app-with-netlify-gatsby-graphql-and-faunadb-53bb)

## Install hub

Hub is new to me. I installed it using Homebrew. I recommend that you install it and create your project folder before you start this collection.

```bash
brew install hub

hub version
git version 2.25.0
hub version 2.14.1 # ← it works!

# indicate that you prefer HTTPS to SSH git clone URLs
git config --global hub.protocol https
```

## Create the local repository

cd into your empty project folder mine is called serverless-todo

The first thing Chris instructs us to do is initialize the git repo.

`git init .`

This command creates a `README.md` file for the repo

`echo "Serverless TODOs" > README.md`

You can preview the contents of the file with `cat`

`cat README.md`

Add the README to your local git repo

`git add README.md`

`gcmsg 'readme'`

Chris uses an alias to commit. I'd never seen these before and I didn't realize that they were already enabled on my zsh. If you use zsh, the [git plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git) gets you a whole list of useful aliases. I found this article that shows you how to set them up in bash.

## Using hub to create the repo on GitHub

Chris already has hub installed and the alias set up. I had to figure out how to get to this point on my computer.

There's a command you can use to get the instructions.
https://hub.github.com/hub-alias.1.html

```
hub alias
```

```
hub create
```

push and follow the link hub created. You will see your README published on GitHub

```
git push -u origin master
```
